    <p>Paneer (pronounced [/pəˈniːr/]), also known as ponir (pronounced [po̯ni̯r]), is a fresh acid-set cheese common in the Indian subcontinent (India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) made from full-fat buffalo milk or cow milk.[1] It is a non-aged, non-melting soft cheese made by curdling milk with a fruit- or vegetable-derived acid, such as lemon juice. </p>
